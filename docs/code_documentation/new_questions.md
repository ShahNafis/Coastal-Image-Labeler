# New Questions

This section of the documentation is focused on how to upload develop questions
and add them to the labeler. We refer to individual questions and question sets
—  a group of related questions that is applied to a given catalog of images. 

This is done in MongoDB. The easiest route is currently to cut/paste an existing
question set and modify as needed.

<show example>

Currently, new question sets can accommodate radio buttons, check boxes, and text
boxes.

The new question set can be applied to a given catalog by applying the ObjectID for
the question set to a given catalog
