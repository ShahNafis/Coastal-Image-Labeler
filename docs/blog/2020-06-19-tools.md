These are the tools/resources/guides I used for the project.

<!--truncate-->

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Is really the core of the project and dictated alot of the design structure and allowed for some really neat things such as server side rendering.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The library that Next.js uses. React is amazing. Theres really nothging more that I can say other then that.
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - While having a functional website is cool, having a *nice* looking one is also good.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Makes web servers in Node.js really easy 
- [React-Hook-Forms](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Makes form creation **really** easy and helped with allowing for modular forms for Catalogs.
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) - Which is a Cloud MongoDB service by MongoDB which removes one extra thing that I dont have to worry about.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - For adding Object Relation Modeling to a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) - Which allows for Oauth login with Gmail and other services and removes one other thing that I dont have to worry about since they handle security for me.
- [Docusaurus V2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) - Which is the package that created this site that you are reading on. Its pretty cool and looks really nice.
- [Commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js#readme) - Which makes making CLI's easy
- [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) - For making getting user input in a CLI easy.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For allowing me to use new JavaScript features before they come out, adding static typing  and helping me catch a few errors before hand.
- [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations) - For cool art (used on docs site).
- [manypixels](https://www.manypixels.co/gallery/) - For cool art (used on docs site).
- [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for making the code look nicer
- [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb/featured) - He is a YouTuber that does videos on programming topics,
  mostly webdev. He has a repo
  [here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devcamper-api) about building a backend
  with node.js for a fullstack prokject. He also has a video/guide on node js deployment (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oykl1Ih9pMg] with instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/cd90d1ed3c462fe3bddd11bf8953a896)

There are ofcourse **way** more packages I used, which you can find in the various `package.json` files through out the project, just these are the key ones.
