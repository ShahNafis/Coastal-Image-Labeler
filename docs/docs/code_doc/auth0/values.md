## Finding values on Auth0

After logging into Auth0, you can find values:

Go to my `Applications` and select the correct one.
![app6](../../../img/code_documentation/my_applications.png "Applications6")

The secret values can be found here.
![app5](../../../img/code_documentation/secret_values.png "Applications5")

And then set the callback URLS. Here they are localhost because of testing but for production they would be the machines IP.
