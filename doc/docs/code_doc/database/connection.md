## IP Whitelisting

There are a few IP's to whitelist.

1. IP's of vm.
2. IP's of developers
3. IP's of Auth0

The Auth0 IP's are found [here](https://auth0.com/docs/security/whitelist-ip-addresses)

```
35.167.74.121, 
35.166.202.113, 
35.160.3.103, 
54.183.64.135, 
54.67.77.38, 
54.67.15.170, 
54.183.204.205, 
35.171.156.124, 
18.233.90.226, 
3.211.189.167, 
18.232.225.224, 
34.233.19.82, 
52.204.128.250, 
3.132.201.78, 
3.19.44.88, 
3.20.244.231
```

Another option is to allow connection from all IP's, but that reduces security.
